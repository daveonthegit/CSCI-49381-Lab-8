      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p> A Slowloris attack is an application-layer attack, which
        operates by utilizing partial HTTP requests. The attack
        functions by opening connections to a targeted Web server and
        then keeping those connections open as long as it can. </p>
      <p><img src="./Slowloris.png" width="750"> </p>
      <p> Slowloris keeps connections open by continuously sending
        partial Web requests. Since the request is never completed the
        server cannot process it and close the connection. Affected
        servers will keep these connections open, filling their maximum
        concurrent connection pool, eventually denying additional
        connection attempts from legitimate clients. </p>
